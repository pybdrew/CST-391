> Quick link to [API Code](../../MusicAPI/)  
> Quick link to [Frontend Code](../../musicapp/)  

This assignment focuses on completing the Music Application by integrating it with back-end services. Using MAMP and the Express MusicAPI, the goal is to provide a live dataset that connects seamlessly with the Angular front end. I applied skills in API integration, routing, and data handling to ensure the application delivers dynamic, real-time functionality.

## Conclusion
By completing this integration, the Music Application gains full functionality, transforming from a static project into a dynamic, data-driven solution. This assignment reinforces the importance of connecting front-end interfaces with back-end services while strengthening practical skills in web development. The finished application demonstrates the value of structured API design and efficient data management for future projects.
