*Figure 1: Node and NPM were installed, and the current versions are listed. This
should be two screenshots, but it's small enough to fit into one!*

## NodeJS "Hello World" Application

*Figure 2: This is a screenshot of the terminal running the Hello World console
application. Hello world is displayed, as is done with most introductions
to a new language.*

*Figure 3: In this image, we upgraded from a console application to a browser. The
text was changed to say hello to the course.*

## Nodemon

*Figure 4: This image moved from node to nodemon. The activity system says to
change the text to demonstrate the detection of change in the source
code, but I was not feeling very creative.*

## NodeJS with TypeScript "Hello TypeScript" Application

*Figure 5: It is noted in the image itself, but we switched from JavaScript to
TypeScript and are still running in the browser.*

## Commented Code

*Figure 6: Here, we have the app.ts code and the terminal output with the code
running. This code follows the code provided by the activity.*

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this activity demonstrated installing essential tools and running a simple Hello World RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.
