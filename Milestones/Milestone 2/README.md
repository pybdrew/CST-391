# Introduction
This is builds upon [Milestone 1](../../Milestones/Milestone%201/README.md). Inclusion is a Christian-themed personal study web app that will allow users to create, read, update, and delete personal study notes tied to specific Bible verses and translations. The app is designed to help users engage with scripture, compare translations, and keep a personal record of their insights. For this proposal, the planned database will include a VerseComments table, and the REST API currently provides endpoints to get all comments, get a comment by ID, update a comment, and delete a comment. Create functionality will be added in future iterations.
